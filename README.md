## Description

The Reader View is a feature that strips away clutter like buttons, ads and background images, and changes the pageâ€™s text size, contrast and layout for better readability. However it can not always be activated by a click on the address bar icon as not all sites are considered reader-able by Firefox. This add-on adds a button to the toolbar as well as a shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+Y) which forcibly activates the Reader View even if the icon in the address bar is not present. If the reader view is natively supported for the webpage, then it activates the native reader view.
The ability of the Reader View to make sites readable is not affected by this add-on.
Note that some pages might still not work.

The shortcut can be modified from the addon page "Manage Extension Shortcuts" option.
