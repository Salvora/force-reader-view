## Description

Reader View in Firefox helps you strip away clutter like buttons, ads, background images and videos, providing a clean and customizable reading experience.

Unfortunately, sometimes due to the structure of the webpage, it cannot be activated natively as not all sites are considered reader-able by Firefox.

This add-on adds a button to the toolbar as well as a shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+Y) which forcibly activates the Reader View even if the icon in the address bar is not present. If the reader view is natively supported for the webpage, then it activates the native reader view. In this way, this addon provides a unified way to activate the reader mode both in read-able and unread-able pages.
The ability of the Reader View to make sites readable is not affected by this add-on.
Note that some pages might still not work.
The shortcut can be modified from the addon page "Manage Extension Shortcuts" option.
